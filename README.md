# About me:
I am a developer specialized in web technologies, with a focus on frontend. My background is focused on CSS, Javascript, HTML5, React.js, and Electron.js, although I also have some knowledge of some backend technologies, such as Python, PHP, and MongoDB. I work with important tools like GIT, Docker, Drupal and WordPress.

I consider myself a minimalist professional, always seeking to use the minimum tools and technologies necessary for each project, adjusting to its scalability and budget.

I also give computer classes, both privately and in high school workshops. I consider it an important part of my personal growth since learning to transmit ideas and concepts improves my ability to acquire new ones and I contribute to the important cause of preparing people for the future.
